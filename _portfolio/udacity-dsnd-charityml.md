_This project is the first of a series of seven projects to be delivered as part of the `Udacity DataScience Nanodegree` self-study._
{: .small style="text-align: justify;"}
It is a **supervised learning classification problem** in which you work for a fictional entity named *CharityML*. The goal is to find, among a given dataset, if people have a sufficient income and then classify them as a potential donor.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
Several classification models from the ***[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)*** package are trained:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines
* Gradient Boosting Classifier

They are then evaluated and one is chosen for further tuning. **Feature importance** and **feature selection** is also performed.
