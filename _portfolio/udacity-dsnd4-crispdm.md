_This project is the fourth of a series of seven projects to be delivered as part of the `Udacity DataScience Nanodegree` self-study._  
{: .small style="text-align: justify;"}
Within the course, in order to develop our communication skills as DataScientist, we are asked to pick a dataset available on the Internet. 
There are suggestions but we can take any dataset as soon as we explore it and follow the CRISP-DM process:
* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment

I chose to use datasets from Airbnb and, as a french people, I chose Paris as the city to analyze.  
You cand find here [my blog post](/things-you-should-now-before-visiting-Paris/) about this project.
